## Instructions

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Project Info.

### Languages Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

### Other Tools:
Materialize CSS and Moment.js

### How It Works:
When a user loads up the application, they will see a series of hour rows and with an input field in each row. The user is able to plan out their busy day by entering in a task for a specific hour slot. Once the task is typed in, the user must click the "add icon" to save the task to local storage. The rows are color coded to make it easier for the user to know what task should be accomplished in any given hour.
